2. Click on 'Clone or download' and copy the SSH key
3. In your terminal, in your desired location, carry out the command 'git clone -SSH key-'

### Challenges
The nested resource was an especially difficult concept to get around and was technically challenging. It was tricky to link the nested resource with both other resources and then display the linked information on the page.

### Learning points
Git workflow improved due to multiple branches and merges. I also have a better understanding of controllers, models, and views and how they all link together.
